# OTTrack - Shift Creation, Management, and Assignment Software

## Description
Developed by Gregory Josephs, OTTrack is an easy-to-use, yet robust, solution for offering, assigning, and tracking overtime shifts for collective bargaining unit employees in the Aquatics department at MIT. Taking into account factors such as seniority, assignment history, employee schedules, and employee shift preferences, the software allows managers to create groups of shifts (offerings), and intelligently and automatically assign them following contractually-defined rules.
